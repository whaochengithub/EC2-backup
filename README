Input

	ec2backup takes as input the volume from amazon, in order to error check this the script 
	will check to see if the volume starts with 'vol-' and has between 8-20 alphanumeric 
	charachers on the assumption that amazon will continue to name thier volumes this way but
	they might get longer.

Volume Creation
	
	ec2backup calculates the size of the volume to be twice the size of the directory to backed
	up except when the file is less than 1 GB. In the smallest case (> 1 GB) ec2backup creates a
	volume of 2GB in size in order to make the volume more reusable. This assumption is 
	contingent on the tendency for file size to grow and the overall growth of filesize as 
	programs and users generate more data.

Key Pair and Security Group
	
	The Keypair and the Security Group are to come from the AWS_EC2_BACKUP_FLAGS, if these two do
	not exist the ssh connection has a great probility to fail and exit. Only the "security-groups"
	and "key-name" parameters may be used to pass these two variables. After these variables are
	checked for existence they are also checked against the users list of available keys and groups.
	If they do not exist in the list the program will exit. Finally these variables can still cause
	the program to exit at instance creation time if they are incorrectly configured. One particular
	case that will cause the program to exit are incorrectly configured ports, ec2_backup does not
	check for port configuration but will exit if an ssh connection cannot be established.

SSH KEY

	ec2_backup always uses the default ssh key pair configured on the system. The program was built to
	be key agnostic in the sense that it can be passed any ssh keypair via EC2_BACKUP_FLAGS_SSH (using
	the -i option) but does not check to see that the pair supplied in the flags matches the ssh key 
	baked into the instance at creation time. If there is a key mismatch the program will exit gracefully
	and print the error output of SSH to STDERR along with a message prefix.

	does not support ~ path expansion for SSH key pairs. All keypairs passed using the -i flag in the 
	EC2_BACKUP_FLAGS_SSH must include the absolute path. This is because passing the relative path in 
	ssh -i prompts a check to /etc/passwd for the users home directory and appears to be handled incorrectly
	by ssh if the user does not have an entry like on the linuxlab system where this program will run.
